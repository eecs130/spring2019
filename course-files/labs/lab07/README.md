# Lab 07 Instructions
This week, there are two ways to receive full credit in lab:

### Option 1
Your attendance (and earnest participation) in lab is enough to earn full lab credit (since weâ€™ll be answering questions regarding [HW6](../../homework/hw06/README)).


### Option 2
If reviewing [HW6](../../homework/hw06/README) is not useful to you but you still want to receive credit for lab, please complete one of the optional enhancements for HW6 listed below (see descriptions on page 2 for more details). If you choose this option, you must submit a link to your GitHub pages and describe the enhancement that you completed so that your TA can give you credit.

* Create a "Mashup" (simultaneously querying two or more APIs to present information from both)
* Integrate an interesting UI detail using a third-party JavaScript widget (or make your own)!
* Create and implement an interesting desktop and mobile/responsive design
